# Ellensburg-Parks-and-Rec

The Ellensburg Parks and Rec Website is a basic web page that allows users to easily schedule events at a local park in Ellensburg. Since the city of Ellensburg has
a very high elderly population. I decided to make an easy-to-use website that would allow older people to easily navigate and schedule events at local parks. This 
web application offers an easy-to-use interface, as well as simple and clear instructions on each tab. This was to ensure that elderly people could navigate the website
easily. This web application is still in development and will be updated daily.


# How to Use this application

In the about section of this GitHub Repo, you can find the link to the site. Open up the link in a new tab and follow the instructions on screen.
